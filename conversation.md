Take the role of a senior trainer and create complete course content on python and data structurues and algorithms and problem solving  approach and skills thereby after this course I should be able to transform from complete beginner to expert in solving hacker rank or leetcode problems in coding. Take your time and don't ask for confirmation on each and every file. Create complete content on this folder and proivde proper index page also to navigate to these. Github  readme format is good.

complete content is not created. Please cross check clearly and create all

there are many missing links in 01-java-fundamentals\\readme.md file

there are no space contraints, please be elaborative in all the topics and how small the topic be and also continue remaining topics.

in the github workflow I set action to check whether links working or not. And below is the output.

cd "c:\\Users\\vmadmin\\Desktop\\python-dsa"; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "check-links-simple.ps1"
